# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

The plan MUST include explicit answers for the following items; unresolved violations MUST be justified in the Complexity Tracking table.

- Linting & Formatting: Which linters/formatters will be used and how they will run (pre-commit/CI).
- Tests: Test strategy (unit, integration, e2e), minimum required test coverage for this feature, and where tests will live. For P1 stories tests SHOULD be written before implementation (TDD encouraged).
- CI Gates: Which CI workflows must pass for this feature (lint, tests, security scans, integration checks) and any additional required checks.
- UX & Accessibility: For user-facing changes include design references, acceptance criteria, and accessibility checks to be performed (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen-reader semantics).
- Observability & Docs: Required logs/metrics, runtime checks, and developer docs (quickstart, run/debug notes) that will be added or updated.
- Migration & Compatibility: For changes that alter public APIs or data formats include a migration plan, backward compatibility notes, and changelog entry.

If any of the above items cannot be satisfied prior to Phase 0, document the reason and an explicit mitigation plan. The plan author (or repository owner for solo projects) signs off on any accepted deviations.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
